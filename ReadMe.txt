This model is designed to represent infiltration (Green-Ampt), interception (Rutter), and runoff (kinematic wave).
All the model code is contained in "kinematic.c"
Matlab scripts are used to write model input files and read model output files

The easiest way to run the example code, which would require Matlab, is to:
(1) Execute "WriteInputFiles.m" to write the input files that the model will be looking for
(2) Compile and Execute "kinematic.c" to run the model
(3) When the C code had finished running, execute "ReadOutputFiles.m" to plot results 

If you follow these steps to run the example as it is set up, the C code should finish 
running in several minutes. The example code is set up to simulate runoff in a small
watershed in response to a short (15-minute duration) rainstorm. 

Alternatively, you can construct the input files in whatever way is convenient for you.
You will need to make sure that they have the same format as those that are produced by
the Matlab code "WriteInputFiles.m".
